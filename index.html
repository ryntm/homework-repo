                <p><img src="./assets/images/headshot-ryan.jpg" class="headshot-resize" id="bio-image">Hi! My name is Ryan Tam. I was born 
                and raised in Seattle (yes, those people exist.) 
                 I went to the University of Washington for my undergrad and then found a marketing job in Seattle as well. 
                I've worked for online marketing companies for the past 10 years. 
                
                <br><br>
                As of 2019, I have a fiance, BUT our wedding in the summer of 2020. Also, I have a six year old pitbull named 
                <a href="./assets/images/friday.png" target="_blank">Friday.</a> Friday is often characterized as the happiest 
                dog in the world.
                
                <br><br>
                I'm hoping to expand my knowledge in the coding world and building the fun ideas that I have. 
                I'm also looking forward 
                to coming up with more ideas as my knowledge about coding expands.
